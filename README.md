# challenge-cripto-react-native

Our React-native coding challenge is a simple "Crypto Tracker". Users should be able to add new cryptocurrencies, visualize the current price and the change in price in % for the last 24 hours, and also be able to remove a cryptocurrency from the "Crypto Tracker". 

```
Important: Please make sure you use ReactNative and Redux. 
Check your solution into github with a readme.md file detailing instructions 
on how to get the app up and running..
```
